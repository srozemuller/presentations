Join us to revolutionize how you manage and secure your digital environment. This session is your key to unlocking a more secure, efficient, and resilient future.

In the session @kennethvs and I will show you how to automate your Conditional Access testing. We will show you how to use the Microsoft Graph API to create a test user, assign a Conditional Access policy, and log in with the test user. We will also show you how to use the Microsoft Graph API to clean up the test user.
We showed how to ingest data into Log Analytics using custom logs. If you want more information about how to configure, can find my blog posts here:
